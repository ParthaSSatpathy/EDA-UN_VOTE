##Set up the libraries
```{r setup, include=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(countrycode)
```

```{r read}
##Read the data from github
x <- read.delim("https://github.com/datasciencelabs/data/raw/master/rawvotingdata13.tab")

##To view the data frame in a better format and save it as votes
votes <- tbl_df(x)
```

```{r use dplyr}
##Pipe Operator- x %>% f(,y) tells you to pass the variable before the operator to the fuction f(x,y)
##It helps you chain a series of command together

##Deplyr verbs
##Filter() -> subsets the observation
##mutate() -> adds a new variable or modifies existing one

votes %>% filter(vote <= 3)
votes %>% mutate(year=session+1945)

##Combine the above 2 functions using pipe
votes %>%
  filter(vote <= 3) %>%
  mutate(year=session+1945)

# Convert country code 100
countrycode(100,"cown","country.name")

# Add a country column within the mutate: votes_processed
votes_processed <- votes %>%
  filter(vote <= 3) %>%
  mutate(year = session + 1945,country=countrycode(ccode,"cown","country.name"))

##summrize() turns many rows into one
votes_processed %>% summarize(total=n()) ##show the no of rowa

votes_processed %>%
  summarize(total=n(),percent_yes = mean(vote == 1))
##The above will fist compare if vote==1, it will consider true as 1 and false as 0,
##It will then calculate the mean. So finally it will give the percentages of yes

##summarize considers the whole group, but if we want to summarize at sub group levels
##we will use group_by
##Below code is to see no of votes and percentage of Yes for every year
##We will group the data set in years before summarizing
votes_processed %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(total=n(),percent_yes = mean(vote == 1))

# Summarize by country: by_country
by_country <-
  votes_processed %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(total = n(),
            percent_yes = mean(vote == 1))

##arrange() sorts a table based on a variable
by_country %>% 
  arrange(percent_yes)

# Now sort in descending order
by_country %>%
  arrange(desc(percent_yes))

# Filter out countries with fewer than 100 votes
by_country %>%
  filter(total>100) %>%
  arrange(percent_yes)

```

## Analysis using ggplots

```{r Visualizing by Year, echo=TRUE}
#########Visualizing by Year######################
by_year <- votes_processed %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(total=n(),
            percent_yes=mean(vote==1))
##ggplot has 3 important parts to it
ggplot(by_year, #1. Data Set
       aes(x = year, y = percent_yes)) + #2. X and Y axis
       geom_line() #3. Layer - (type of) graph on the XY-plane

# Change to scatter plot and add smoothing curve
ggplot(by_year, aes(year, percent_yes)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

#########Visualizing by Year and Country######################

##Select the yearly data only for USA
by_year_country_USA <-
  votes_processed %>%
  group_by(year,country) %>% ##Here grou by on both year and country
  summarize(total=n(),percent_yes=mean(vote==1)) %>%
  filter(country == "United States of America")

##Select the yearly data only for USA and France
by_year_country_USA_France <-
  votes_processed %>%
  group_by(year,country) %>% ##Here grou by on both year and country
  summarize(total=n(),percent_yes=mean(vote==1)) %>%
  filter(country %in% c("United States of America","France")) ##Check the %in% for multiple selection

##Compare the US and Farnce data over the years
##For this we can distinguish between the two countries using color aesthetic
ggplot(by_year_country_USA_France,
       aes(x=year,y=percent_yes,color=country)) + geom_line()
       
# Start with by_year_country dataset
by_year_country <- votes_processed %>%
  group_by(year, country) %>%
  summarize(total = n(),
            percent_yes = mean(vote == 1))

# Print by_year_country
by_year_country

# Create a filtered version: UK_by_year
UK_by_year <-
  by_year_country %>%
  filter(country=="United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland")

# Line plot of percent_yes over time for UK only
ggplot(UK_by_year, aes(year,percent_yes)) + geom_line()

# Vector of four countries to examine
countries <- c("United States of America",
               "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland",
               "France", "India")

# Filter by_year_country: filterebd_4_countries
filtered_4_countries <-
  by_year_country %>%

# Line plot of % yes in four countries
ggplot(filtered_4_countries, aes(year,percent_yes,color=country))+geom_line()
